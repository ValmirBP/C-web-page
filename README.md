Welcome to my C#.NET Web Application! This repository contains the source code and resources for our exciting web application built using C#.NET.
# About:
This project demonstrates my skills in applying the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern in C#.NET. It consists of a static website that is responsive and fully functional. You can navigate pages, view information, and interact with elements. This project aims to show how MVC can facilitate the development of web applications, separating the data, logic and presentation layers.
